GitHub User Language Breakdown (github-user-languages) shows a breakdown of languages a GitHub user has used in their public repositories. It doesn't require you to log in, all you need to do is type in a valid GitHub username (profile name).

## How to use
It's very simple. Just head on to [this website](https://github-user-language-breakdown.herokuapp.com/), enter your GitHub username (profile name) and wait for the chart to appear.
